# Practical Cryptography for Developers Book

A modern practical book about cryptography for developers with code examples, covering core concepts like: hashes (like SHA-3 and BLAKE2), MAC codes (like HMAC and GMAC), key derivation (like Scrypt, Argon2), key agreement protocols (DHKE, ECDH), symmetric ciphers (AES, block modes, ChaCha20, authenticated encryption, AEAD), asymmetric ciphers (RSA, ECC, ECIES), elliptic curves (secp256k1, curve25519), digital signatures (ECDSA and EdDSA), random numbers (PRNG, CSRNG) and quantum-safe cryptography.
