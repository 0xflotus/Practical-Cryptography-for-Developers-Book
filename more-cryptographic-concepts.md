A cipher suite is a set of algorithms that help secure a network connection that uses Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) or its now-deprecated predecessor Secure Socket Layer \(SSL\). The set of algorithms that cipher suites usually contain include: a **key exchange** algorithm, a **symmetric encryption** algorithm, and a message **authentication code** \(MAC\) algorithm.
