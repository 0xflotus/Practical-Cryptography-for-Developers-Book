# EdDSA Cryptosystem and the Curve "Ed25519"

...

**Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm** \(EdDSA\) uses twisted Edwards curves, designed by D. Bernstein and others.

The **Ed25519** is a cryptosystem is based on the ECC \(elliptic-curve cryptography\) concepts â€“ [http://ed25519.cr.yp.to](http://ed25519.cr.yp.to)

Uses the Edwards's curve Curve25519 \(RFC7748\)

**EdDSA** \(using curve25519\) is **faster** than ECDSA \(using secp256k1\) at **similar level of security** \(even slightly better\).
