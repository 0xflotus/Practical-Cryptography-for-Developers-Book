# ECDSA: Elliptic Curve Signatures

The [**ECDSA**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm) \(Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm\) is a cryptographically secure **digital signature scheme**, based on the elliptic-curve cryptography \(**ECC**\). **ECDSA** relies on the math of the **cyclic groups of elliptic curves over finite fields** and on the difficulty of the [**ECDLP problem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography#Rationale) \(elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem\). The [**ECDSA sign / verify**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm) algorithm works as described below.

## Key Generation

**ECDSA** uses cryptographic **elliptic curves** \(EC\) over finite prime field in the classical Weierstrass form. These curves are described by their **EC domain parameters**, specified by cryptographic standards such as [**SECG: SEC 2**](http://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf) and **Brainpool \(RFC 5639\)**.
